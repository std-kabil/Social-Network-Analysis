## Notes about page count

IEEE double-column page count depends on formatting (font, margins, figure sizes). This draft is intentionally written with enough detail to become **~24 pages** once converted to IEEE double-column format with figures and tables. If you want, I can later help you convert it into LaTeX IEEE conference style and tune length.

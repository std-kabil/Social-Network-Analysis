# Abstract

Large-scale online social networks are valuable real-world graphs for studying connectivity, community structure, and the feasibility of “six degrees of separation.” However, when a dataset contains **millions of nodes and tens of millions of edges**, a naïve analysis can easily exceed the memory limits of a typical student laptop and lead to unstable workflows.

In this project, I analyze the **Pokec social network** dataset from SNAP (soc-Pokec), focusing on **topological properties** only. Pokec is a Slovak online social network where the original friendship relations are **directed**. To study how reciprocity changes network structure, I work with two graph interpretations: (1) an “all connections” undirected view (treat each directed relation as an undirected connection), and (2) a “mutual friendships” graph that keeps only **reciprocated** edges.

To keep the analysis feasible under limited memory, I designed a **sampling-based pipeline** and implemented it in an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard. The pipeline extracts the **largest connected component (LCC)**, estimates the distribution of shortest-path lengths by sampling node pairs, computes basic metrics (average degree, density, clustering coefficient on a sampled set of nodes), performs community detection using **Louvain** on a BFS-sampled subgraph, and computes centrality rankings on a manageable subgraph. I also implemented a “Network Explorer” visualization and path-finding tool based on a sampled subgraph, and addressed practical engineering challenges such as stale output artifacts, UI state management, and rendering performance.

Using the mutual-friendships configuration, the directed graph has **1,632,803 nodes** and **30,622,564 edges**, and the extracted mutual graph contains **8,320,600** reciprocal edges. The mutual graph’s LCC contains **1,198,274 nodes** (about **73.39%** of all nodes) and **8,312,834 edges**. A shortest-path sampling experiment with **10,000** random node pairs produced an average distance of **5.67** (median **6**, max observed **11**), consistent with a small-world structure. Louvain community detection on a 50,000-node BFS sample produced **37** communities with modularity **0.7855**, indicating strong community structure in the sampled subgraph.

Finally, to make the project “cooler” and more complete, I add a lightweight machine learning extension: **link prediction** on the visualization subgraph using classical graph similarity features (Common Neighbors, Jaccard, Adamic–Adar, Preferential Attachment, and degree-based features) and logistic regression. On the 1,000-node visualization subgraph, the model achieved **ROC-AUC ≈ 0.936** and **Average Precision ≈ 0.940** under a balanced positive/negative sampling protocol.

Overall, the project demonstrates that meaningful network analysis is possible on a student machine if we carefully choose graph representations, avoid memory-heavy operations, and rely on controlled sampling and interactive tooling.

# Report (Markdown) — Merge & Conversion Notes

This folder contains the report written as multiple Markdown files so it is easier to edit and (later) convert to IEEE double-column format.

## Recommended merge order

1. `00_Title.md`
2. `01_Abstract.md`
3. `02_Introduction.md`
4. `03_Related_Works.md`

6. `04_Methods_PartB_Sampling_and_Algorithms.md`
7. `04_Methods_PartC_System_Implementation_Streamlit.md`
8. `04_Methods_PartD_Reproducibility_and_Artifacts.md`
9. `05_Experimental_Results.md`

11. `07_References.md`

## Notes about “~24 pages”

Page count depends on the final IEEE template (margins, font size, figure placement).

To reach ~24 IEEE double-column pages, you will typically need:

- multiple figures (degree histogram, path length histogram, community sizes, network visualization)
- at least one table (the summary table is already generated as `network_summary_*.png`)
- optional appendix material (full parameter sweeps, additional plots)

This draft is intentionally detailed. If it becomes too long after conversion, you can shorten:

- the “Methods (Part B/C/D)” narrative
- repeated explanations of sampling
- the ML section (keep as optional extension)

## Suggested figure sources

Use figures generated by the Streamlit app in `outputs/`:

- `degree_distribution_mutual.html` (screenshot for report)
- `path_length_distribution_mutual.html`
- `network_summary_mutual.png`
- `network_visualization_mutual.html` (screenshot)
- `community_sizes_mutual.html`
- `top_degree_centrality_mutual.html`
- `top_betweenness_mutual.html`
- ML: `link_prediction_roc_mutual.html`, `link_prediction_pr_mutual.html`

## Next improvement (recommended)

For a stronger Experimental Results section, run **All connections** mode and export:

- `analysis_results_all.json`
- the corresponding plots and summary table

Then extend `05_Experimental_Results.md` with a direct mutual vs all comparison table.

# Social Network Analysis: Six Degrees of Separation

A data mining project analyzing the **soc-Pokec** dataset to empirically test the "six degrees of separation" theory using graph mining techniques.

Code repository (fill in): <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>

## Project Overview

This project implements social network analysis on the soc-Pokec dataset (Slovak social network with 1.6M users and 30M relationships) to:

- Compute average shortest path lengths (degrees of separation)
- Analyze network properties (clustering, centrality, density)
- Perform community detection using Louvain algorithm
- Identify influential hub nodes
- Predict potential new connections via link prediction

The implementation supports two graph interpretations:

- **Mutual friendships**: keep only reciprocated edges (closer to real-world acquaintance chains)
- **All connections**: treat every directed edge as an undirected connection

## Dataset

**soc-Pokec** from [Stanford SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Pokec.html):

- **Nodes**: ~1.6 million users
- **Edges**: ~30 million directed friendships
- **Attributes**: 59 profile fields (age, gender, region, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Social-Network-Analysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Option A (recommended): Streamlit dashboard

Run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard will:

- Load the dataset and build the graph (mutual vs all)
- Extract the largest connected component (LCC)
- Estimate shortest-path distribution via sampling
- Compute summary metrics (degree, density, clustering)
- Run Louvain community detection on a BFS sample
- Compute centrality rankings on a BFS sample
- Run link prediction (ML) on the visualization subgraph
- Export JSON/CSV/PNG artifacts into `outputs/`

### Option B: Jupyter notebook

Open:

```bash
jupyter notebook main_analysis.ipynb
```

2. Run cells sequentially. The notebook will:
   - Download the dataset automatically (~500MB compressed)
   - Load and preprocess the graph
   - Compute degrees of separation
   - Perform community detection and centrality analysis
   - Generate visualizations

**Note**: The full graph is large. Sampling is used for computationally intensive operations. A machine with **16GB RAM minimum** (32GB recommended) is strongly advised.

## Key Findings

Results depend on graph mode and sampling configuration. A typical mutual-mode run (exported in `outputs/analysis_results_mutual.json`) reports:

| Metric                        | Value   |
| ----------------------------- | ------- |
| Average Degrees of Separation | ~5.67   |
| Median Degrees of Separation  | 6       |
| Max Observed Distance         | 11      |
| Avg. Clustering Coefficient   | ~0.105  |
| Louvain Modularity (sample)   | ~0.7855 |

The analysis confirms the "small-world" property of social networks, with most users connected within 6 degrees.

## Techniques Used

- **Graph Mining**: NetworkX for graph operations
- **Community Detection**: Louvain algorithm (python-louvain)
- **Centrality Measures**: Degree, Betweenness, PageRank
- **Link Prediction**: Jaccard coefficient, Adamic-Adar index
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- 16GB+ RAM (32GB recommended)
- ~2GB disk space for dataset

## LaTeX Report

The IEEE-style report lives in `report_tex/`.

- **Main file**: `report_tex/report.tex`
- **Parts**: `report_tex/parts/*.tex`
- **Concatenated build**: `report_tex/report_full.tex` (generated by `report_tex/concat_report.py`)

To generate the concatenated file:

```bash
python3 report_tex/concat_report.py
```

To compile (requires a TeX distribution providing `pdflatex`):

```bash
pdflatex report_tex/report.tex
pdflatex report_tex/report.tex
```
